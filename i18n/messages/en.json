    "internships": "Internships",
    "documentDeadline": "Can I submit documents after the deadline?",
    "documentDeadlineAnswer": "No, WSH-E gives us a specific time by which we must have your documents prepared. Student ID numbers are also assigned by this time, which are necessary to qualify you for studies. After the deadline, WSH-E does not generate additional ID numbers, which means that applications are not accepted.",
    "groupRec": "Can we report a group of people for some one direction?",
    "groupRecAnswer": "Of course, yes. In this case, we make sure that everyone is in one group, if the group is large we allow the possibility of setting an individual schedule of meetings (the number of meetings is the same as in the study program, but classes can be held on other days, such as Fridays).",
    "courseOrder": "Can we order customized training from you?",
    "courseOrderAnswer": "Of course. There is such a possibility both in the area of on-site and remote training in real time. We also accept orders for online training to be listened to at a time and place of your choice.",

    "parcticsMagnoliaAnswer": "Of course. We invite all willing students who would like to do specialized internships at PP-P MAGNOLIA in Rybnik. We provide therapies in speech therapy, neurology, sensory integration, hand therapy, tyflopedagogy, therapies with children on the autism spectrum, etc.  We also provide TUS classes, physiotherapy, psychological and pedagogical consultations, and conduct diagnoses. We cordially invite all interested persons to do their internship at PP-P MAGNOLIA.",

    "parcticsOnline": "Can internships be done online?",
    "parcticsOnlineAnswer": "We are sorry but it is not possible. Internships should be held stationary in the number of hours provided in the curriculum. There are reasons to reduce the hours of internships, each request is considered individually by the Dean of WSH-E. The application should be submitted after the start of studies, up to 30 days after the start of classes.",

    "diplomaCopy": "How can I certify a copy of my diploma as true to the original?",
    "diplomaCopyAnswer": "You can certify it by writing the sentence: \"I confirm this is a true copy of the original\" on the copy and confirming it with your handwritten signature. This form is accepted by WSH-E.",

    "doctoralDiploma": "Can I send a copy of my doctoral studies diploma?",
    "doctoralDiplomaAnswer": "Unfortunately not, WSH-E only accepts copies of second degree diplomas.",

    "shortenTwoSemestersAnswer": "Absolutely not, a two-semester course cannot be shortened.",
    "observationSheet": "Who should sign the observation sheet?",
    "observationSheetAnswer": "The intern conducts classes that are observed by the Internship Supervisor who evaluates the intern. Therefore, the internship supervisor signs the document.",
    "observationSheetModule": "To which module should I attach the observation sheet?",
    "observationSheetModuleAnswer": "The observation sheet is attached to the module in which the intern is required to conduct classes independently.",
    "internshipDeadline": "When do I need to submit my internship documents?",
    "internshipDeadlineAnswer": "We submit internship documents as follows for the intake: October intake: March 30th of the following year, March intake: January 30th of the following year.",
    "internshipSettlement": "What does the internship submission/settlement deadline mean?",
    "internshipSettlementAnswer": "This means that if the settlement deadline is, for example, March 30th, the documents must be in the dean's office by March 30th at the latest in order to settle the internship on time.",
    "completeDocuments": "Why do I need to send all internship documents together?",
    "completeDocumentsAnswer": "Due to the number of students, it is very important that internship documents are sent together in accordance with the \"specialist internship credit\" file. Your documents are sent to WSH-E and checked there for content - the more missing documents, the longer you will wait for your certificate.",
    "documentStatus": "I haven't received a response about whether everything is okay with my internship documents, what does this mean?",
    "documentStatusAnswer": "Most often, this means that WSH-E has checked the documents and has no comments. Comments are sent to students via email. However, it's always worth contacting us in this case to double-check."
